                                            OWNERSHIP RULES
        1.Each value in rust has owner
        2.There can be one owner at a time
        3.When the owner goes out of scope, the values will be dropped


        ex :
            {
                let data = "hello"            

                ///
                /// 
                /// 
                /// 
                /// 
                /// 
                /// -------- do anything you want with this string 
                  
            }    ------> this scope is now over and data string is not valid

            : data string is only valide within curly braces

                                        OWNERSHIP IN REAL LIFE


    example:

            Imagine you have a car. In Rust's world, the car is like a piece of data in the computer's memory. 
            Now, let's introduce the concept of ownership.


        1)Single Owner:

            You are the sole owner of your car. Only you can drive it and decide what happens to it.
            In Rust, a piece of data in memory (like your car) can have only one owner.

        2)Transferring Ownership:

            If you decide to sell your car, ownership transfers to the new owner. Now, they have control over the car.
            Similarly, in Rust, ownership of data can be transferred from one variable to another through moves.

        3)Access Through Owner:

            The new owner can use the car however they want, but you can't drive it anymore. You've given up ownership.
            In Rust, only the current owner of data can access and modify it. Once ownership transfers, the previous owner can't use it.
            
        4)Memory Deallocation:

            If you sell your car, you don't need to worry about it when someone else owns it. They are responsible for it.
            In Rust, when the owner of data goes out of scope, Rust automatically deallocates (returns) the memory associated with that data.
           
        4)Undefined Behavior:

            Imagine if, after selling your car, you try to drive it. That's undefined behavior â€“ it doesn't make sense.
            Similarly, in Rust, trying to use data after it has been moved to another owner leads to undefined behavior.
           
        5)Cloning:

            If you want to keep a copy of your car, you can clone it. Now, you have two identical cars.
            In Rust, if you want two variables to own the same data, you can clone it. Both variables will have their own copies.

            let my_car:String = String::from("BMW");     
            let friend_car = my_car.clone();
                                                        ..... now
